**Who were the original owners?**
Quaglet and Andytimbo were, but they stepped down because they didn't want to moderate the server anymore. Ownership was passed to me and Duck.

**Why is talking about the server banned from the Hypixel Forums?**
On March 9th, 2021 Teddy notified us that there was "excessive inappropriate content written about other people, death threats, planning of violations of our rules and many, many more" on the server. Some of these allegations have yet to be proven (staff refuse to provide any evidence), and the rest have been dealt with.

**What's the server about?**
Kinda just general Hypixel gaming.

**Why doesn't the server get many new members?**
Forum Sweats is kind of like a big group chat where there's not much of a need for new members.
